Agile teams do not rely on traditional project management techniques to track dependencies. 
This extension provides a lightweight way to manage dependencies on other teams.


## Quick steps to get started
1. Navigate to your backlog and review your backlog items
2. Select the "Dependencies" tab
3. A list of all the items on your backlog should display with all their dependencies (using the predecessor or successor links) 
4. Solid colored blocks are items under your area paths (i.e. on your backlog) and those with "empty" blocks are items on another teams backlog.
